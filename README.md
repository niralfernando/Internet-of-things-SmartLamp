The objective of this code is to control a table lamp using a smartphone. I used a microcontroller called [electric imp]("http://electricimp.com/). Electric imp is a microcontroller that also has a built-in wifi adapter and electric imp's API lets you control the micrcontroller remotely. It is awsome!

I am currently working on a toggle switch that utilizes javascript to perform http tranfer instead of having a 2 buttons for ON and OFF functionality.
